> Project Requirement Specification
        üìå Functional Requirements
        1. Vulnerability Detection
                Must detect common web application vulnerabilities, including:
                SQL Injection (SQLi)
                Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
                Outdated third-party components (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap)
                Security misconfigurations (e.g., exposed directories, verbose headers)
        2. CVE Integration
                Integrate with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to:
                Fetch CVE updates in real-time
                Cache CVE data locally for offline scans
                Map detected issues to known CVEs with CVSS severity scores
        3. Performance Optimization
                Engineered for fast scanning speeds through:
                Asynchronous HTTP requests
                Selective payload fuzzing
                Threading or multiprocessing
                Accuracy must not be compromised; false positives and negatives must be minimized.
        4. Automated Reporting Engine
                Uses HuggingFace‚Äôs LLM API to generate natural language reports.
                Supports export formats:
                Microsoft Word (.docx)
                JSON (.json)
                PDF (.pdf)
                Reports should include:
                Summary of findings
                Proof of concept (PoC) snippets
                Step-by-step remediation guidance
                Severity ratings based on CVSS scores
                Business impact analysis
        5. User Interface
                Fully command-line interface (CLI) driven.
                Requires minimal setup and should work on any modern Linux distribution.
        6. Wordlist Support
                Allows the user to specify custom payload files (e.g., from SecLists, FuzzDB).
        üîí Non-Functional Requirements
        1. Portability
                Tool must be operable in Linux environments without dependencies on commercial tools or platforms.
        2. Open-Source Accessibility
                Codebase to be published under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
                Designed as a free alternative to commercial scanners like Acunetix and Burp Suite.
        3. Usability
                Should offer:
                Clean terminal output
                Intuitive CLI options (via argparse or click)
                Usage examples in help menu (--help)
        4. Extensibility
                Modular codebase to support easy addition of:
                New vulnerability types
                Additional report formats
                API support (e.g., Slack alerts, webhook integration)
        üìä Pain Points Addressed
        Based on user research, WebScanr focuses on:
        Clarity of reports: Through LLM-powered descriptions and clean formatting
        Scan speed: Optimized through fast HTTP engines and fuzzing strategies
        Accuracy and relevance: By mapping findings to NVD CVEs
        Actionability: Every issue comes with clear remediation steps
        Export flexibility: Supports preferred report formats (PDF, Word, JSON)


The proposed automated web vulnerability scanner, ‚ÄúWebScanr‚Äù must effectively detect common vulnerabilities including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, outdated components, and security misconfigurations, while integrating real-time NVD/CVE updates with offline caching capabilities. Performance optimization is critical and the proposed scanner should be prioritizing fast scanning speeds while maintaining high accuracy. The reporting engine, powered by HuggingFace's LLM API, should generate comprehensive yet clear reports in Word, JSON or PDF formats corresponding to user‚Äôs preference. The report should contain proof of concepts, step-by-step remediation guidance, severity ratings based on CVSS scores, and business impact analysis. For usability, the tool will feature a command-line interface built with Python for Linux environments, designed with minimal setup complexity. As a free and open-source solution, it aims to serve as an accessible alternative to commercial scanners like Acunetix. These requirements directly address the top pain points identified in user surveys, focusing on report clarity, accuracy, and speed while incorporating the most requested features such as actionable remediation steps and multiple export formats.
