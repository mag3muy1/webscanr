      "name": "CVE-2019-8331 - Bootstrap -",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "score": 6.1,
      "description": "Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework used for building responsive and mobile-first web projects. CVE-2019-8331 is a vulnerability related to Bootstrap's carousel component, which is used to create a slideshow of images or other content. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by injecting malicious scripts into the carousel's indicators, which are used to navigate between slides. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into clicking on a specially crafted link or visiting a malicious website, leading to the execution of the injected script in the user's browser. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, session hijacking, or the spreading of malware. The technical impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it can lead to a complete compromise of the user's web session and potentially the underlying system. However, the CVSS score for this vulnerability is not provided, as it depends on various factors such as the specific use case and the attacker's capabilities.",

      "remediation": [
        "1. Patching (Priority 1): The most effective mitigation for CVE-2019-8331 is to apply the latest patches released by the Bootstrap team as soon as possible. This will ensure that the vulnerability is addressed and that the system is no longer at risk. The patch can be applied by updating the Bootstrap library to the latest version available.",
        "2. Virtual Patching (Priority 2): If patching cannot be performed immediately, consider implementing virtual patching. This involves applying a rule or filter to the web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block any traffic attempting to exploit the vulnerability. This will provide temporary protection until the patch can be applied.",
        "3. Input Validation (Priority 3): Implement input validation to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being processed by the application. This can help prevent attacks that exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the application. Input validation should be implemented on both the client-side and server-side to provide an additional layer of security.",
        "4. Access Control (Priority 4): Implement access control measures to restrict access to sensitive areas of the application. This can help prevent unauthorized access to the application and limit the potential impact of an attack. Access control measures can include user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and least privilege principles.",
        "5. Regular Security Audits (Priority 5): Regularly perform security audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the application. This can help ensure that the application remains secure over time and that any new vulnerabilities are identified and addressed promptly. Security audits should include both manual and automated testing methods to ensure comprehensive coverage."
